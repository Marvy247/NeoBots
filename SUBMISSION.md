## Key Talking Points

1. **Novel Concept**: First marketplace where AI agents are BOTH buyers and sellers
2. **Real Functionality**: Actual x402 payments on Base, not a mock
3. **Autonomous Economy**: Agents earn, spend, and track ROI independently
4. **Composable Workflows**: Summarizer agent orchestrates calls to Researcher + Analyzer
5. **Production Ready**: Full stack with beautiful UI, error handling, real-time updates

## Demo Flow

1. Show dashboard with agent stats
2. Navigate to marketplace, show 3 agents
3. Show live activity feed
4. Run demo script: `npm run demo`
5. Watch real-time updates as agents call each other
6. Show transaction history with actual payments
